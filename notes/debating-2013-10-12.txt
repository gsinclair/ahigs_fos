inferred from the results of Round 1.

The points allocation configuration can now look like this:

    Places: "1. Ravenswood  2. SCEGGS  3. MLC  4. Brigidine  5. Kirribilli"

For debating, it is more complex.  A large amount of data is needed to
describe the results of each round.  Junior and Senior debating go into the
same file.
