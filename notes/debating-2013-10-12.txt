inferred from the results of Round 1.

* results.yaml

The results for a normal section look like this:

  - Section: Current Affairs
    Places: "1. Ravenswood  2. SCEGGS  3. MLC  4. Brigidine  5. Kirribilli"
    Nonparticipants:
     - Ascham
     - Kincoppal
     - OLMC
     - Queenwood
     - StPatricks

For debating, it is more complex.  A large amount of data is needed to
describe the results of each round.  Junior and Senior debating each get
their own results file.
