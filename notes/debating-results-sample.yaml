# For 2013, I will need to record Debating.  This is a multi-round competition,
# so needs its own way of recording the results, almost certainly in a separate
# file from the other sections.  This is an idea of what it could look like.
# There is no need to identify "debating" in the contents of the file; it would
# have a special filename.

Nonparticipants:
 - NEGS
 - OLMC
 - Ravenswood

# 26 teams -> 13 winners, 13 losers
# I don't know what would happen if there were an odd number of teams. It seems
# unfair to hand 5 points to a random team for a bye, and it seems unfair NOT to
# give them points, too. So I'm assuming an even number of teams at the moment.
# Also, the guidelines say 28 teams start.  What if there are 29 or 30 teams
# participating?
