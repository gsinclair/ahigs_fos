	# and that the main methods called will be:
	#   results_for_school(Monte) -> [ [:p,3], [:r1,2], [:r2a,2], [:qf,3], [:sf,5] ]
	#                                # note this implies Monte made it to the grand final but didn't win
	#   results_for_school(OLMC)  -> [ [:p,3], [:r2b,2], [:qf,3] ]
	#                                # note OLMC lost Round 1 but won Round 2B and drew the wildcard to enter the QF
	#   points_for_school(Monte)  -> 15
	#   points_for_school(OLMC)   -> 8
	#   participating_schools     -> [...]        (perhaps, if needed)
  #
  # Finally, it is important that we can check the correctness of the debating results data.
  # That is, the winners and losers exactly match the schools registered in each round;
  # the winners from each round proceed to the appropriate next round, that Rounds 2A and 2B
  # are handled correctly; that wildcards work.
  # 
  # This is done with DebatingResults#check_validity.
