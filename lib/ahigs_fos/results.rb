  # Places is essentially a list of five schools. It is fed a string like:
  #   "1. Frensham  2. Danebank  3. PLCS  4. Kirribilli  5. Normanhurst"
  # and stores a hash like:
  #   { School[Frensham] => 1, School[Danebank] => 2, ... }
  # That is, it does school lookup and stores the results for later query.
  # The hash is keyed by school, not place, as ties are possible, and we can't
  # have two "3" keys in a hash, for instance.
  # This class also handles validation, so that results with non-existent or
  # duplicate schools, or more or less than five places will not be allowed
  # through.
